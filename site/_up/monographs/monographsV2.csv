Lack of information on the type species described by Phillips made their identifications in Carboniferous faunas for over 150 years uncertain. Re-examination of ammonoids from the Gilbertson Collection revealed that the type specimens contained in the collection after being re-described and re-figured provide much additional information. There are 182 specimens representing 35 species (3 holotypes, 15 lectotypes, and 58 paralectotypes), the identity of which was confirmed as a result of this study. Examination of Phillips' original drawings and notes in the Library of Oxford University Museum of Natural History and their comparison with the material from the Gilbertson Collection revealed that some illustrations based on specimens from the Gilbertson Collection were omitted from the final publication. These specimens are here re-described and illustrated, and their status as types is confirmed.","626.jpg",346,,

P.","The anatomy and systematics of Eustreptospondylus oxoniensis, a theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of Oxfordshire, England",,"pp. 1-82, pls 1-20","Dinosaurs",110,110,55,"Recent work on theropod phylogeny has concentrated on the interrelationships of taxa that lie close to the ancestry of birds (coeltirosaurs), whereas only a small number of studies have investigated the evolution of more primitive theropods (e.g. basal tetanurans). Ghost lineages implied by theropod phylogenies suggest that the Middle Jurassic was an important time in tetanuran evolution, witnessing the initial radiation and diversification of the clade. However, Middle Jurassic theropod specimens are rare and often incomplete.The holotype c specimen of Eustreptospondylus oxoniensis, from the Middle Oxford Clay (upper Callovian) of Oxfordshire, England, represents the most complete Middle Jurassic theropod specimen from Europe. This taxon therefore has the potential to shed much needed light on basal tetanuran evolution at a critical time in the clade's history. Although several previous authors considered the anatomy and systematics of Eustreptospondylus, none of these accounts provided a comprehensive description and their utility is therefore limited. Here, we provide a detailed redescription of Eustreptospondylus and confirm its phylogenetic position as a basal member of Spinosauroidea. The taxon exhibits several anatomical features that appear to he incipient versions of the highly specialized character states found in more derived members of the clade (e.g. development of the premaxillary/maxillary embayment). The results of this work also suggest that Spinosauroidea may have originated in the Middle Jurassic of Europe, later dispersing to Gondwana.","627.jpg",329,,

","Upper Ordovician chitinozoans from the British historical type areas and adjacent key sections",,"pp. 1-113, pls 1-31","Chitinozoans",85,85,42.5,"Recent developments in chronostratigraphical procedure and new biostratigraphical insights have necessitated revision of the Ordovician System's chronostratigraphy. As a part of this process, the chitinozoan assemblages from the historical type areas of the British Caradoc and Ashgill Series are described, and the first Upper Ordovician chitinozoan biozonation for British Avalonia is established. The historical Caradoc and Ashgill type sections in the Anglo-Welsh basin yield important chitinozoan assemblages; these data are supplemented with information from other British key sections with accurate graptolite control. As a result, the established chitinozoan biozonation for British Avalonia is tied closely to the British chronostratigraphical framework and graptolite biostratigraphy. This volume provides systematic descriptions of the chitinozoan taxa recovered from the sections studied during this biozonation project in the UK, comprising 23 genera and 131 species, of which five are new: Acanthochitina latebrosa, Acanthochitina pudica, Belonechitina brittanica, Hercochitina frangiata and Spinachitina katherinae.","628.jpg",281,,

The type specimen museum registration number, the stratigraphical horizon and the geographical locality for each species are given, with National Grid References for Great Britain (but not Ireland) where possible. Lower Palaeozoic brachiopods which have been described and illustrated since 1960, but only identified to genera, are also listed (apart from those in more general literature). 1501 taxa are discussed, of which 1075 are species and subspecies considered valid, 231 are in open nomenclature, 152 are synonyms, 34 are nomina dubia and nine belong to other phyla (although originally described as brachiopods). More than a hundred holotypes or lectotypes of species originally erected some years ago are figured, many of which are photographed for the first time. No new taxa are published here.","629.jpg",220,,

A further five species are left in open nomenclature. Five of these genera (Miotoxaster, Pliotoxaster, Mecaster, Leymeriaster and Periaster) have not been recorded from Britain before.

Here we present a complete description of the holotype and referred specimens, which together comprise approximately 70% of the skeleton. Neovenator possesses numerous autapomorphies and clearly belongs to Allosauroidea, a clade of basal tetanuran theropods that includes Allosaurus, Sinraptor, and the Carcharodontosauridae, a subgroup that contains some of the largest known theropods. Several synapomorphies support Neovenator as the basalmost member of Carcharodontosauridae. These are primarily features of the postcranial skeleton, indicating that large body size and the highly apomorphic skull of derived carcharodontosaurids evolved after changes to the axial and appendicular skeleton. This placement suggests that basal carcharodontosaurids were more widespread before becoming restricted to Gondwana later in their evolution.","631.jpg",299,,
